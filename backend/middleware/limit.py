"""Rate limiting, for the endpoints where guessing is the attack.

    LIMITS is the whole answer to "what is throttled, and how hard?"

The same shape as the account gate next door: one table, read by one piece of
middleware, so the policy can be read in ten seconds rather than gathered from
decorators spread across four routers. An endpoint that needs a limit gets a
line here; nothing else changes.

## What this is for

`/api/login` had no limit of any kind. A script could try passwords against an
account as fast as the network allowed, forever, and nothing in the app would
notice or care — no delay, no lockout, no log. That is the whole attack: the
password hashing is real (werkzeug pbkdf2, see tracking/auth.py) and the
session cookie is signed with a key that is no longer guessable, so the front
door was the only way in and it was unlocked.

Three other endpoints are here for a different reason. Sign-up creates rows,
resend sends e-mail, and `/api/suggest_milestones` and `/api/suggest_steps`
spend money at Anthropic — none of them is a way *in*, and all of them are a
way to make the app expensive or noisy for somebody else.

## Two keys, on purpose

Login is limited per IP **and** per account, and the two numbers are
deliberately different.

Per IP is the strict one, because one host trying many passwords is the common
case and there is no honest reason to attempt twenty sign-ins a minute from one
address.

Per account is the loose one, and it is loose for a reason worth stating: a
tight per-account limit is itself an attack. Anyone who knows your username
could lock you out of your own account by failing to log in as you a few times,
which trades a password-guessing problem for a denial-of-service one. So the
per-account budget is generous enough that a real person sharing an office
network never reaches it, and tight enough to make a slow distributed guessing
run take months.

**On the credential endpoints, only failures count.** A successful sign-in
clears both counters, so somebody who typed their password wrong twice and then
got it right starts fresh, and a long-lived session refreshing pages is never
throttled at all.

## The money endpoints are the other way round

The three `suggest_*` paths are not a way in and are not guessed at; they are a
way to spend somebody else's Anthropic key, and their cost lands when they
*work*. Charging them as failures did not limit them — it un-limited them,
because the middleware clears a key on success, so every working request wiped
the budget it had just spent and a loop of them never reached a limit.

They are `charge=CALLS`: every request counts, nothing clears. And they are
keyed per **account** rather than only per address, because the account is what
spends the money — a shared school network is one address for hundreds of
readers, and a phone is a new address every hour. The per-IP budget stays as a
much larger backstop against one host working through a pile of accounts.

## What this is not

In-process and per-worker. Two uvicorn workers keep two sets of counters and a
restart forgets them, so the real budget is the one below times the number of
processes. That is honest for how this runs — one process, SQLite, WAL — and it
is the thing to replace first if the app ever runs behind more than one. A
shared store (Redis, or a table in the database) is the same table above with a
different backend; nothing else here changes.

It is also not a defence against a large botnet, which no per-IP limit is. It
raises the cost of the cheap attack, which is the one that actually happens.
