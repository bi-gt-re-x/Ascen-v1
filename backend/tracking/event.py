"""Calendar events: what is on the calendar and when.

Two kinds of row, each with its own table in events.sql:

  * **entries** — a task placed on a day (`task_id`, `time_block`), which is
    how the calendar shows work that also exists on the dashboard;
  * **events** — a standalone block created on the calendar itself (`name`,
    optional weekly/monthly recurrence and an end date).

`is_default` marks the built-in events that cannot be deleted.

Event colours live in their own store: every hex handed out, stamped with the
ISO week it was claimed in, so the client can pick a new one visibly different
from the rest without the reserved set growing forever. See `colors` below.
