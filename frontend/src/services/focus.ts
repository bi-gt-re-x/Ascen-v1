/**
 * Focus time — how long the user actually sat down and worked.
 *
 * The timer itself runs client-side; what the server keeps is each day's
 * total, so the calendar's Weekly Focus Time panel, the growth chart and
 * focus-type goals all read one number that survives a cleared browser.
 *
 * `syncDay` never lowers a day's recorded total — the backend takes the larger
 * of what it has and what it is sent. That is deliberate: an old tab whose
 * localStorage was cleared would otherwise report a smaller number and erase
 * real work. So calling it too often is harmless, and calling it with a stale
 * value is harmless too.
 *
 * Also here: the one-line note attached to a calendar day, which the Week, Day
 * and Month views all show — an edit in one view lands everywhere.

 * Backend: backend/api/focus.py, backend/api/calendar.py.
