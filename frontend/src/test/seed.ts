/**
 * One whole account, made of arithmetic rather than of luck.
 *
 * The analytics model turns three responses into about eighty figures, and
 * until now nothing drove it end to end: `utils/*` are unit-tested one function
 * at a time, and the tab tests are given a *fake* model, so the assembly — the
 * seventy-nine memos, the window slicing, the two windows that deliberately
 * differ — was the one part with no test at all. The stated reason was that
 * driving the real thing "would mean fabricating a year of day series to move
 * one number". This is that year, fabricated once.
 *
 * ## Why the shape is what it is
 *
 * Every figure here has to be predictable by hand, or the test that reads it
 * can only compare the model against itself. So the account is built out of two
 * rules and nothing else:
 *
 *   * **Four days on, one day off, forever.** `index % 5 !== 4`. Over any run
 *     that starts on a multiple of five and lasts a multiple of five days, the
 *     active count is exactly four fifths of it — no drift, no weekends to
 *     reason about, no calendar arithmetic in the assertions.
 *   * **A step change at the window edge.** Days before `STEP` earn `BEFORE` XP
 *     and days after it earn `AFTER`. That makes every "vs the previous period"
 *     figure on the page a number the test can state as a literal, and it is
 *     the one thing a flat account cannot check: a model that quietly compared
 *     a period against itself would pass every assertion about totals.
 *
 * `TOTAL` is 750 and not 730, and that matters. `sliceWindow` counts back from
 * the end, so a one-year window over exactly 730 days leaves a previous period
 * of 365 that begins on day zero — which is fine until a panel asks what came
 * before *that* and gets an empty array. Twenty days of headroom means every
 * window on the picker has a real period behind it.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * Not a fixture for the tab tests — those are given figures directly and should
 * stay that way (see ./tabs/fixtures). This is for testing the thing that
 * *produces* figures, and it is deliberately the only place in the suite that
 * knows how a real account is shaped.
