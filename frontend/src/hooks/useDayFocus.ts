/**
 * The note on a day — "Focus" — shared by all three calendar views.
 *
 * The Week view's per-day row, the Day view's field and the Month view's
 * "Today's focus…" box are the same note, and they were kept in step by a
 * global (`window.DayFocus`) that every script wrote through. A hook is the
 * same idea with the wiring visible: one cache, one writer, and any view that
 * calls it re-renders when the note changes.
 *
 * ## One note, up to five focuses
 *
 * It was one line. A day usually has more than one thing worth naming, so the
 * Day view now takes up to five — a primary and four after it.
 *
 * They are stored in the one field, newline-separated, and that is a deliberate
 * choice rather than a shortcut. The note is a single string in localStorage,
 * in the server's `day_focus` map and in whatever a Jinja-served page reads;
 * splitting it into five would mean five keys, five endpoints and a migration,
 * to hold something that is a list of short phrases. A newline is a separator
 * no single-line input can produce, so a note written before this reads back as
 * a list of exactly one and nothing has to be converted.
 *
 * The Week and Month views show the **primary** and edit only that — see
 * `primary` and `setPrimary`, which leave the rest of the list untouched. A
 * multi-line string in their single-line inputs would render as the lines run
 * together, and neither view has room for five anyway.
 *
 * Three copies again, and the order matters. localStorage is the synchronous
 * one, under the Week view's historic key (`wkDayFocus:<user>:<iso>`) so a
 * page still served by Jinja reads the same note; the server copy follows the
 * account to another browser and is hydrated on mount; and React state is what
 * the views actually render. A keystroke writes the first two immediately and
 * the third after 800ms of quiet, because a note is typed a character at a
 * time and the endpoint should not be.
 *
 * Ported from day-focus.js.
