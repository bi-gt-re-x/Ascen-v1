/**
 * The dashboard's once-a-day question about the days it did not see.
 *
 * All of the sequencing for the catch-up prompt: deciding whether there is
 * anything to ask, reading what is already recorded so it does not ask twice,
 * writing the answers, and stamping the day either way. The dialog itself is
 * components/Dashboard/CatchUp and the rule about *which* days is
 * utils/catchUp — this is the part that talks to the server, and it is a hook
 * so that neither of those has to.
 *
 * ## It runs once per mount, and usually does nothing
 *
 * The check fires when the preferences arrive and never again for that
 * account: `asked` is the guard, and it has to be a ref rather than state
 * because `update` writes the new `catchup_seen_on` into the context
 * immediately, which re-renders this hook with the very value the check reads.
 * Without the guard that is a loop.
 *
 * It holds the username rather than a boolean, so signing out and back in as
 * somebody else asks that account its own question. A plain `true` would have
 * meant the second account was never asked at all, and only on the machines
 * where two people share a browser — which is exactly the shape of bug that
 * never turns up until it is in front of somebody.
 *
 * The common outcome is no dialog at all. An account that tracks its focus
 * has nothing unrecorded to be asked about, an account on its second load of
 * the day has already been asked, and an account that has turned the prompt
 * off in Settings is never asked. Each of those still stamps the day, so the
 * three "nothing to do" paths and the answered one all leave the account in
 * the same state.
 *
 * ## The stamp is not conditional on the answer
 *
 * Submitting, dismissing and finding nothing all write today into
 * `catchup_seen_on`. A day the reader chose not to log is a day they chose not
 * to log; asking again tomorrow would make the prompt a debt collector, and
 * the one thing it must not become is something people click past without
 * reading. See the note at the top of the dialog.
 *
 * ## A failed write does not lose the dialog
 *
 * If the entries cannot be sent the prompt stays up with what was typed still
 * in it and says so, and the day is not stamped — that is the one case where
 * the reader has said something the app failed to keep, and it is worth the
 * second ask.
