/**
 * The tree generation engine.
 *
 * Takes a goal and produces a progression toward it out of the shared library.
 * Nothing it produces is stored, and nothing it produces is authoritative: a
 * generated tree says *how these skills appear in this person's path*, and the
 * library still says what a skill is and what it depends on. Regenerate with a
 * different goal and you get a different tree over the same nodes, which is the
 * property the whole architecture exists to have.
 *
 * ## The five passes
 *
 * **1. Closure.** From the goal's targets, walk prerequisites backwards through
 * every ref. That is the tree: everything the goal could possibly need, options
 * included. A tree that quietly picked Matplotlib over Plotly for you would be
 * presenting a decision as a fact, so both are drawn and the choice is labelled.
 *
 * **2. Which of them are optional.** A node is an *option* when some node in the
 * tree names it inside a choice — an ANY, or a 3-of-5 — and nothing else in the
 * tree requires it outright. Membership of a choice is not inherited: the five
 * routes into Dynamic Programming are options, and Functions, which three of them
 * happen to descend from, is required, because it is required outright elsewhere.
 * Cascading optionality down the ancestry was the first implementation and it
 * reported eleven of the twelve nodes in the chess tree as optional, which is
 * true of no reading anybody has of that tree.
 *
 * **3. Branches.** Nodes that hang *off* the required path and share the goal's
 * tags — the specialised and mastery branches. Ranked by tag overlap and how far
 * their difficulty sits from the goal's own centre of gravity, then taken until
 * the budget runs out. This is where a tree stops being a line.
 *
 * **4. Order and layer.** Topological, difficulty only breaking ties. An Advanced
 * node cannot precede its foundations however early its tier would sort, because
 * it is not eligible until they are placed — see `topologicalOrder` in
 * skills/graph, where that guarantee actually lives.
 *
 * **5. Status and connections.** Statuses come from evaluating each node's rule
 * against what the request says is held. With nothing held that is every root
 * `available` and everything else `locked`, which is true rather than a
 * placeholder. Real progression is Part 3's; this engine only ever reports what
 * the rules say about the inputs it was given.
 *
 * ## Personalisation is wired, not written
 *
 * `GenerationRequest` accepts the full set of inputs the personalised generator
 * will eventually want, and this version uses them in the simplest defensible
 * way — documented at each use, and each marked as the placeholder it is. The
 * point of accepting them now is that the *shape* of a request never changes
 * when the algorithm behind it gets serious.
 *
 * ## Where AI plugs in
 *
 * Three seams, none of which require this file to call anything. A model can add
 * ids to `targets` or `interests` and the engine builds the tree; it can mint a
 * node with `metadata.source: 'ai'` and the library indexes it like any other;
 * and it can read `notes` on the result to see what the engine decided and why.
 * The graph stays authoritative in all three, because a proposal that contradicts
 * a prerequisite still cannot be placed before it.
