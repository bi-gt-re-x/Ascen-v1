/**
 * The relationship layer: what depends on what, and whether a rule is met.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from the nodes and nothing is stored. Hand it a
 * library and it produces the indexes a generator needs — the reverse edges, the
 * flattened requirement lists, a topological order — and answers the one
 * question the rules exist for: given a set of things somebody has, is this node
 * open?
 *
 * ## Rule kinds live in one table
 *
 * `EVALUATORS` is the only switch over rule kinds in the system. A new kind is
 * an entry there and a variant in the `Prerequisite` union, and every caller —
 * the generator, the status calculation, the sentence the UI prints — keeps
 * working, because none of them ever asks what kind a rule is.
 *
 * ## A bad library must not white-screen the app
 *
 * `buildGraph` validates and *reports* rather than throwing: a prerequisite
 * naming a node that does not exist is dropped from the edge set and recorded in
 * `problems`, a duplicate id keeps the first and records the second, a cycle is
 * broken at the edge that closed it. A library is content, content gets edited,
 * and an editing mistake should cost a warning in the console rather than the
 * whole page.
