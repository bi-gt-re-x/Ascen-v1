/**
 * The confirm-your-e-mail strip.
 *
 * What is worth testing here is not how it looks — it is the four conditions
 * under which it must not appear, because each of them is a way for a request
 * to turn back into the door it replaced. A banner over a confirmed account is
 * a lie; one over a signed-out visitor is a lie about somebody who does not
 * exist; one that cannot be dismissed is a modal in a different shape; and one
 * dismissed for ever means the address is never confirmed and the account
 * cannot be recovered.
 *
 * The fifth is the opposite failure: a banner that is put away on this tab
 * must come back on the next visit, or "dismiss" quietly became "never ask".
 * That one is asserted through `sessionStorage` directly, because a new visit
 * is exactly what a test cannot stage by re-rendering.
