/**
 * The last thing between a thrown error and a white screen.
 *
 * React 19 unmounts the whole tree when a render throws and nothing catches
 * it. Without a boundary anywhere in this app, one bad date, one null field on
 * one panel, took the rail, the top bar and every other page with it — and
 * left nothing on screen to say so or to get back from. The reader's only
 * recovery was to know to reload.
 *
 * ## Where it sits, and why there are two
 *
 * `<AppBoundary>` wraps the router in App.tsx, so a throw inside any page is
 * caught with the rail and the top bar still rendered around it: the reader
 * loses the page they were on and keeps the app they were in. That is the
 * whole reason it is inside the shell rather than around it.
 *
 * `<RootBoundary>` wraps everything in main.tsx and catches what is left — a
 * provider failing, the shell itself throwing — where there is no app to keep,
 * so it draws a full-page apology instead.
 *
 * ## Resetting
 *
 * "Try again" clears the error and re-renders the same subtree. That is worth
 * offering because a good share of these are transient — a response that
 * arrived half-written, a race between two states — and re-rendering is
 * genuinely enough. `resetKey` does the same automatically: App.tsx passes the
 * current path, so navigating away from a page that threw clears it rather
 * than pinning the error over the route the reader just chose.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does not report anywhere. There is no error service in this app and
 * inventing one here would be a networking decision made inside a render
 * boundary. `componentDidCatch` logs to the console with the component stack,
 * which is what a developer sitting in front of it needs; wiring it to
 * something remote is a change to this one method.
 *
 * A boundary catches renders, lifecycles and constructors — not event handlers
 * and not rejected promises. `useApi` already routes async failures into
 * `ErrorState`, which is the right place for them: a fetch that failed is
 * information about the data, not about the code.
