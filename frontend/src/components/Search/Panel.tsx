/**
 * The top bar's search: two categories, a cursor, and no Enter key.
 *
 * ## What it looks for
 *
 * **Tasks** — the account's own work, matched by the server
 * (`/api/tasks/search`), because the task list is the largest thing this app
 * owns and filtering it in the browser is what the top bar used to do.
 *
 * **Components** — the containers the app is made of: pages, the tabs inside
 * them, the sections of Settings. Matched locally against utils/siteIndex,
 * which is where the words a reader actually types are written down.
 *
 * Both are scored on one scale, so "the closest match" means something across
 * the two of them rather than within each.
 *
 * ## It takes you there rather than waiting for Enter
 *
 * The closest match is the cursor's first position and the app goes there.
 * `›` steps to the next match and goes there too; `‹` steps back. So the way
 * to use this is to type until you can see where you are, then walk the
 * matches until the page behind the panel is the one you wanted — which is
 * faster than reading a list, and is the whole reason the arrows are the
 * control rather than a highlighted row waiting on a keypress.
 *
 * Enter still works. It closes the panel, because by then you are already
 * where it would have sent you.
 *
 * ## The keyboard is the whole control, not a shortcut for it
 *
 * Focus never leaves the box, so every key has to work from there:
 *
 *   Down / Up      the next and previous match
 *   Right / Left   the same, but only from the end and the start of the text,
 *                  so typing and correcting still own the caret. They are here
 *                  because the buttons on screen are `›` and `‹`, and a
 *                  control the eye is told to use should answer to the key it
 *                  is drawn as.
 *   Enter          close; you are already there
 *   Escape         close, and put the reader back where they started
 *
 * It is a combobox in the ARIA sense — `role="combobox"` on the box, a listbox
 * of options beneath it, and `aria-activedescendant` naming the one the cursor
 * is on. That last part is what makes this usable with a screen reader at all:
 * the reader's focus is in a text field the entire time, so nothing would be
 * announced as they stepped without it.
 *
 * Escape is handled here as well as by the bar's own listener
 * (components/Topbar.tsx). A `type="search"` box treats Escape as "clear me"
 * and stops it there, so the panel would empty and stay open — and a reader
 * pressing Escape twice would find themselves somewhere they never chose,
 * because clearing the box empties the matches.
 *
 * ## Where a task actually is
 *
 * A task the calendar knows about — `show_on_calendar` with a date on it —
 * lives on a day, so that is where the reader is taken: the Day view, opened
 * on that day, scrolled to the block. Everything else is a list item nobody
 * chose a time for, and lives on the tasks page. Sending both to `/tasks`
 * would be sending half of them to the page they are *not* on, which is the
 * one thing a search must not do.
 *
 * Only unfinished tasks are searched (`searchTasks(..., true)`). This panel's
 * answer to a match is to go there, and there is nothing to go to on a task
 * that is done.
 *
 * ## Why the navigation is an effect on the cursor
 *
 * Every path into this — typing, the arrows, the keyboard, clicking a row —
 * ends in "the cursor is now at N". Navigating from each of those separately
 * is four chances to disagree; navigating from the cursor is one. It is also
 * what makes the behaviour honest while typing: the list is recomputed on
 * change, the cursor lands back on the closest match, and the effect moves the
 * page only when that match is somewhere the reader is not.
 *
 * Replaced rather than pushed. A dozen keystrokes must not become a dozen
 * entries in the history — the reader's Back should be the page they were on
 * before they opened the search, not the eleventh thing the search flew past.
