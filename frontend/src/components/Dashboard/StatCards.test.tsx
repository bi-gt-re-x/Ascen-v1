/**
 * The "vs usual" line, and the mornings it used to spoil.
 *
 * `typicalDay` averages *complete* days and skips today deliberately, so the
 * comparison holds a partial day against finished ones. Before somebody has
 * done anything the arithmetic is `(0 - usual) / usual`, and the card greeted
 * an account with a year of work behind it with a red **↓ 100% vs usual** —
 * every morning, before they had a chance to do anything about it.
 *
 * These pin the three cases the line stays out of, and that it still appears
 * when there is a real comparison to make.
