/**
 * The two moments a day can be won, and the celebration for them.
 *
 * The dashboard has asked for a daily XP goal since the account was made and a
 * daily focus goal since the panel existed, and until now reaching either of
 * them looked exactly like not reaching it: a bar arrived at its end and
 * nothing said so. A goal nobody is told they have met is a number, not a goal.
 *
 * ## Crossing, not exceeding
 *
 * `useCrossing` fires on the *transition* — the reading before was under and
 * this one is not. That distinction is the whole of the bookkeeping, and it is
 * why none of this needs to be remembered anywhere. Reload the page at 300 XP
 * against a 200 goal and the first reading is already over the line, so there
 * is no crossing and no popup; finish the task that takes you from 180 to 210
 * with the page open and there is. Nothing is written to storage, nothing is
 * counted, and the same day cannot be celebrated twice by refreshing it.
 *
 * The first reading is deliberately never a crossing. Both figures start at a
 * placeholder — today's XP is zero until the account's tasks land, and a focus
 * total is read from localStorage before the server confirms it — and treating
 * that first jump as a crossing would fire the popup on every load for anyone
 * who had already met their goal.
 *
 * ## The popup lets go on its own
 *
 * A focus goal is usually crossed *while somebody is working*, which is the
 * worst possible moment to demand a click. So the card dismisses itself after a
 * few seconds, and Escape, the button and the backdrop all take it away sooner.
 * It is not `aria-modal` and it traps nothing: the page underneath is still the
 * page, and this is an announcement rather than a question.
 *
 * The confetti is skipped outright when the reader has asked for less motion,
 * rather than being animated at the near-zero duration the global rule in
 * styles/preferences.css would give it — forty nodes flickering into existence
 * and out again is not a quieter version of the same thing.
