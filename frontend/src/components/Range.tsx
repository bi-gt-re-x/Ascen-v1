/**
 * The mountain range that stands behind a page's opening card.
 *
 * This started on the focus page — see components/Timer/art.tsx, which still
 * owns the sunset behind the quote — and it is here because the range turned
 * out not to be about pomodoros. It is the app's one piece of scenery, and a
 * page that opens with it reads as somewhere you arrived rather than a screen
 * that appeared. Every page's hero now draws one; styles/summit.css is the
 * card it sits in.
 *
 * Inline SVG rather than an image, for the reasons the timer's copy gives: a
 * photograph would be a binary in the repo, a request on every load, a licence
 * to track, and a fixed palette that cannot follow the theme. This one paints
 * with `--peak-a`, `--peak-b`, `--peak-c`, `--peak-surface` and `--peak-snow`,
 * which the hero sets, so a page picks its own weather by naming a tone.
 *
 * `aria-hidden`, always. It carries no information, and a screen reader
 * announcing "mountains" above every page would be reading out the wallpaper.
 *
 * ## Why the ridgelines are generated
 *
 * The timer's three were placed by hand and read well, and twelve pages
 * wearing those same three would read as one wallpaper repeated — which is
 * worse than no scenery, because it tells the eye that nothing changed when
 * the page did. So a range is grown from its name: `variant="goals"` is the
 * same mountains on every visit, and a different set from `variant="tasks"`.
 * The shaping below is what keeps a generated ridge from looking generated.

/**
 * The range along the bottom of a hero.
 *
 * Three ridgelines at falling opacity, with a wash of the card's own colour
 * laid over each one's base. The wash is what does the work: a distant ridge
 * is not merely paler, it is *eaten into* from the bottom by the air in front
 * of it, and drawing that is the difference between three silhouettes stacked
 * up and three mountains standing at three distances.
 *
 * `meet` rather than `slice`. `slice` scales a picture to *cover* its box and
 * discards whatever hangs over the edge, so on a tall hero the range would be
 * scaled past its own size and cropped — and what the crop takes first is the
 * left-hand fade, which lives in the drawing's coordinates. The range would
 * then end in exactly the hard vertical line that fade exists to prevent.
 * `meet` scales to fit, so the whole range is in the box whatever shape the
 * card is; anchoring bottom-right leaves the spare room above it, which is sky.
 *
 * Gradient ids are scoped with `useId`, because two heroes on one page with
 * two different tones would otherwise share one set of definitions and the
 * second would silently paint in the first one's colours.
 *
 * ## The wrapper is what does the clipping, and it has to be
 *
 * The range and the sky behind it both run past the card — the range's own
 * paths overshoot both sides so a drifting layer cannot pull its end into
 * view, and the sky is a wash half again the card's height. So something has
 * to be `overflow: hidden` with the card's radius on it, and the obvious
 * candidate is the card.
 *
 * It cannot be. Two of the headers a hero now wraps carry dropdown menus — the
 * overflow menu on Tasks, the tools on Goals — and a menu is a positioned
 * child of the header, so a card that clips its scenery clips the menu too and
 * the page silently loses a control. `.peak-scene` is an inert layer behind
 * the content that clips itself instead, which leaves the card free to let
 * anything hang out of it. See styles/summit.css.
