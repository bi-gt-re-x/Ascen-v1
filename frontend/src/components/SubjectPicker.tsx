/**
 * "What is this about?" — the optional subject on a new task.
 *
 * It has two states and the difference between them is the whole design.
 *
 * **Closed** it is a single button: the chosen subject's icon and name, or the
 * invitation to pick one. That is all a finished field needs to be, and a
 * dialog with three rows of pills sitting under a question already answered is
 * a dialog that looks unfinished.
 *
 * **Open** it is a text input with the catalogue laid out beneath it as one
 * scrolling row of pills. The row opens on the subjects this account uses most
 * — the backend orders the list that way (see backend/api/subjects.py) — so
 * the first thing a returning reader sees is their own five or six, not the
 * letter A. Typing in the input filters the row rather than searching a
 * separate dropdown: what is being narrowed stays visible while it narrows.
 *
 * Picking a pill closes it back to the button. There is no confirm step,
 * because there is nothing to confirm: the choice *is* the click, and the
 * button that replaces the row is the receipt.
 *
 * The whole thing is optional. `null` is a first-class value here — the button
 * offers to clear the choice once one has been made, and a task saved with no
 * subject is an ordinary task rather than an incomplete one.
