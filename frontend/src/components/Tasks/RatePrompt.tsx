/**
 * "Rate your performance on this task" — the one question the app asks back.
 *
 * Everything else on a task is measured: what it was worth, how long it took,
 * whether it beat its deadline. None of that knows whether the work was hard or
 * whether it went well, and those are the two things the person who did it
 * knows and the database never will.
 *
 * ## Two rows, not one
 *
 * Difficulty and execution are independent, and collapsing them into a single
 * "how did that go" loses the distinction that makes either worth having: an
 * easy task done badly and a brutal one done well both land on three stars, and
 * they are not the same week. Asked apart, they stay apart in the record.
 *
 * ## How much is asked is the account's to choose
 *
 * Three depths, set in Settings (or on Analytics, beside the panels that read
 * them). At `none` this dialog never opens at all — the caller does not raise
 * it. At `ratings` it is the two rows above. At `reasons` a third question
 * follows them: the one thing that made the difference, from a closed list of
 * six.
 *
 * **The third question depends on the second.** It cannot be asked until the
 * execution star is answered, because which six words are offered follows from
 * it — a task rated 1 is asked what made it hard, a task rated 4 what made it
 * go well. So the row appears when execution is answered and changes sides if
 * that answer changes, which also clears an answer that no longer belongs to
 * the list it came from.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is required
 *
 * The task is already done and its XP is already banked before this appears —
 * see `rateTask` in services/tasks for why the two are separate calls. So this
 * dialog can be dismissed, ignored, or half-answered, and all three are fine.
 * Escape closes it, the backdrop closes it, and Skip closes it; only the stars
 * that were actually clicked are sent. A prompt that blocked the reward it
 * follows would be a toll booth, and people learn to click through those
 * without reading, which would poison the very data it exists to collect.
