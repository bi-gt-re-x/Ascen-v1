/**
 * "Complete today's tasks" — one press for the whole day.
 *
 * Used in both places a task is finished: at the head of the tasks page's list,
 * and under the dashboard's Tasks card. It holds no opinion about which tasks
 * are today's — `tasks` is whatever the caller means by the day, and the two
 * callers do not mean quite the same thing. The tasks page means what is *due*
 * today, because overdue work is grouped and labelled apart there. The
 * dashboard means what its Today tab holds, which is the plate: due today,
 * overdue, and undated. Each button sits directly under the list it acts on,
 * which is what makes both readings the obvious one where they are.
 *
 * ## Why it is not the bulk bar
 *
 * The bulk bar already completes many tasks at once, and this could have been
 * "select all, then press it". It is separate because the two answer different
 * questions. The bulk bar acts on *what the reader picked*, whatever that is;
 * this acts on *what today is*, which is a fact about the account and not about
 * the current selection or the current filters. Making it a selection shortcut
 * would mean the day's meaning changed when a subject chip was pressed, and a
 * button called "today" that completes four of the day's seven tasks because
 * three are filtered out is a button that lies.
 *
 * So it reaches past what is on screen deliberately, and pays for it by saying
 * so. `hidden` is how many of the tasks it is about the reader cannot see — the
 * tasks page's filters keeping them out, or the dashboard card's row cap — and
 * the dialog prints that line whenever it is not zero. The rule both surfaces
 * are built on is that a reader is never surprised by what an action touched,
 * and disclosure satisfies it; silence would not.
 *
 * ## Two questions in one dialog
 *
 * Completing a day's work is a dozen XP awards, a streak extension and a level
 * recalculation, and it is tedious to undo one row at a time — so it confirms.
 * The confirmation names the count and lists the first few titles, because
 * "complete 7 tasks?" is not something anybody can check the truth of.
 *
 * The second question rides along rather than following as a second dialog:
 * whether to be asked, afterwards, how each one went. It appears only when the
 * account has ratings switched on at all (`rating_depth` is not 'none'), which
 * is what `canReview` carries — this component never reads settings itself, so
 * the page keeps that decision in the one place it already lives.
 *
 * It defaults to on. The account has said in Settings that it wants to rate its
 * work; defaulting the box to off would quietly overrule that, and the whole
 * reason the box is here is that seven prompts in a row is a bigger ask than
 * one and deserves to be declinable in advance. See components/Tasks/RatePrompt
 * for what is then asked, and why nothing about it is required.
