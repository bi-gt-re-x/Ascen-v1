/**
 * The first thing a new account does on the skill tree: pick five subjects.
 *
 * ## Why this is a screen and not a default
 *
 * The band across the top has always been five subjects, and until now they
 * were *derived* — the five this account had filed the most tasks under, with
 * a "Change" button under each. That is the right behaviour for an account
 * with a term of work behind it and the wrong one for an account with none: a
 * new reader arrived at a hundred-subject rail and a band of five subjects
 * chosen by a tie-break between zeroes, with nothing on the page telling them
 * the band was theirs to set.
 *
 * So the derivation stays, and it is what this screen *offers* rather than
 * what it silently applies. The reader picks five, or takes the suggestion in
 * one click, and either way the five in the band afterwards are five they
 * agreed to. See utils/focusTopics for where the answer is kept and why the
 * stored value is subject ids rather than the trees they route to.
 *
 * ## It is shown once, on the count
 *
 * The gate is `loadFocus` returning null — this account has never chosen —
 * which is a different state from "chose and then cleared it". Nothing here
 * writes a "seen" flag: choosing five *is* the flag, and a reader who wants
 * the screen again gets it from the band's own "Choose again".
 *
 * ## Exactly five, and the counter says so
 *
 * Not "up to five". The band holds five and a band with a hole in it is worse
 * than a band of subjects somebody is lukewarm about — the same argument
 * `resolveFocus` makes for topping the list up. Continue stays disabled until
 * the fifth is picked, the counter is live, and a sixth click swaps the oldest
 * pick out rather than being refused, because a disabled subject that gives no
 * reason reads as a broken button.
