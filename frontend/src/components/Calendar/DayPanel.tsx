 * than an empty field beside a dash.
 *
 * The daily goal sits above the list, because it is what the list is *for*:
 * the cards say what there is to do and the bar says how much of the day's
 * target the finished ones have already bought. It is the same goal the
 * dashboard's XP panel and the settings page hold — one number, three places
