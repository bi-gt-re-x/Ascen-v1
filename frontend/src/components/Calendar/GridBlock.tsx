/**
 * One block on the time grid — an event, or a task.
 *
 * The two share a shape and differ in what they can tell you. An event says
 * when it runs; a task carries its XP, its difficulty and whether it is
 * overdue, finished, or running on into tomorrow. Both carry the icon guessed
 * from their name and the three-dots menu.
 *
 * **No colour is written here.** Every block carries `data-family` — one of the
 * twelve in utils/eventPalette — and styles/calendar/palette.css turns that into
 * a tint, an edge and an ink for whichever theme and state it is in. The one
 * thing that is not the family's is a task's left edge, which is its
 * difficulty; the category is then carried by the tint and by the dot beside
 * the name, so it is never invisible.
 *
 * A task's *name* is the button, not the block: clicking it finishes the task.
 * That is deliberate and is why the title has a role of its own — the rest of
 * the block is the block, and only the name is a commitment.
