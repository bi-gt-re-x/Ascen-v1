/**
 * The Month view's overview column — everything below the day's plan.
 *
 * Three panels, and each is scoped to the month on screen rather than to
 * "now": stepping back a month steps all of them back, so every number in the
 * column is answering a question about the same thirty days as the grid beside
 * it. That is the whole reason the column is readable.
 *
 * Monthly Overview is four tiles of fact. Top Performing Days is the same
 * month's XP, ranked — the one panel that tells the reader *which* days did the
 * work, which is a question a grid of shaded squares can only gesture at.
 * Monthly Insights is one sentence about the month against the month before,
 * chosen from the figures rather than fixed (see utils/monthSummary).
 *
 * Nothing here has a "no data" state that hides the panel: a month with nothing
 * in it is a real answer and the panels say so, because a column that vanishes
 * when the month is empty is a column the reader learns not to trust.
