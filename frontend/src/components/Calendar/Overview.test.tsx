/**
 * The panel the three calendar views share.
 *
 * What is worth pinning here is not that it renders — it is that the three
 * scales say the *same* things in the *same* order, because that is the whole
 * reason it exists. Three separately-written panels drifted into three
 * vocabularies once already; nothing but a test stops the next well-meant edit
 * adding a figure to the month and not the week.
 *
 * So the assertions are mostly comparisons between scales rather than checks
 * against fixed strings.
