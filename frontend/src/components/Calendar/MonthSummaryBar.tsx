/**
 * The strip under the month grid — how the month is going, in one line.
 *
 * A ring and three figures, each carried against the same month a year's worth
 * of habit is actually judged by: the one before it. The comparison is the
 * point of the strip. "6,240 XP" is a number; "6,240 XP, up 18% on July" is a
 * month.
 *
 * A figure with nothing to compare against says nothing rather than something
 * absurd — a first month is not an infinite improvement on the void before it —
 * so the delta line is simply absent until there is a previous month with
 * something in it.
 *
 * This stands where "Day Completion Progress" used to. That ring answered a
 * question about the selected day while sitting under a grid of thirty of
 * them, and the day it described already has a whole column of its own on the
 * right.
