/**
 * What the period on screen came to — the same four figures, in the same
 * order, under the same words, at all three magnifications.
 *
 * The three views each grew their own version of this panel and each invented
 * its own vocabulary for it. Laid side by side they were:
 *
 *     Week   This Week Progress   Tasks · Completed · XP Earned
 *     Day    Daily Overview       Tasks · Focus Time · XP Earned · Streak
 *     Month  Monthly Overview     Tasks · Focus Time · XP Earned · Best Day
 *
 * — three names for the panel, two different meanings for "Tasks" (a count in
 * one, a fraction in the other two), a Focus Time the Week view did not have at
 * all, and three sets of markup to draw them in. A reader moving between the
 * views had to re-learn the column each time, and could not hold a day against
 * its week because the two were not saying the same thing.
 *
 * ## What is shared and what is not
 *
 * Three of the four tiles are fixed, because they are the three questions
 * every period answers: how much of what I planned did I finish, how long did
 * I work, and what did it earn. They read identically at every scale; only the
 * sub-line changes, and it changes to name the period, which is the one thing
 * that differs.
 *
 * The fourth is the view's own, and deliberately so. A day has a streak and a
 * month does not; a month has a best day and a day cannot. Forcing a fourth
 * shared figure would have meant either dropping all three or inventing one
 * nobody asked for — so the slot is a prop, and each view fills it with the
 * thing only it can say.
 *
 * `lead` is the same argument for the panel's head: the Week view opens with a
 * completion ring, which is its own and belongs above the tiles rather than
 * squeezed into one.
 *
 * Drawn by styles/calendar/overview.css, which all three views import.
