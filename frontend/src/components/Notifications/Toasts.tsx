/**
 * Notifications, on the screen rather than behind a bell.
 *
 * ## Shown once, and then only in the bell
 *
 * A pop-up appears for a notification the account has not been shown yet, and
 * the provider stamps it the moment this draws it — so it appears once, on the
 * screen it arrived on, and after that it lives in the panel like everything
 * else. Closing one is a thing that happens to the pop-up: the notification is
 * still in the bell afterwards, which is why the ✕ here says "close" and the ✕
 * in the panel says "delete".
 *
 * ## Three at a time, and it leaves on its own
 *
 * A stack that can cover the page is a stack people learn to dismiss without
 * reading. Three is enough to notice a busy morning and few enough to see the
 * app underneath; the rest wait in the bell, where the badge says how many.
 *
 * Each one leaves after `LIFE_MS` unless the pointer is on it — a reader in
 * the middle of the sentence should not have it taken away — and the whole
 * stack sits outside the click-outside handling in components/Topbar.tsx,
 * because a pop-up over the page is not part of any panel.
 *
 * ## It is off when the account says so
 *
 * `notify_popups` in Settings takes this away and leaves the bell working,
 * which is the half of a notification system people actually want to turn off.
 * The provider applies it, so nothing here has to know.
