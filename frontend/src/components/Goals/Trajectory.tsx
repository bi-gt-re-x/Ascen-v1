/**
 * Where a goal is on the way from where it started to where it is going.
 *
 * ## Why a rail and not another percentage
 *
 * "88%" is true and says almost nothing. It does not say 88% of what, it does
 * not say what the number would have to become, and it does not say how far
 * that is from here. A rail says all three at once: the scale is drawn, the
 * target is a mark on it, and the distance between them is a length you can
 * see rather than a subtraction you have to do.
 *
 * So a number goal draws its own scale — 0 to the target, marked at the value
 * it is on — and prints the three figures underneath that a percentage hides:
 * where you are, where you are going, and what is left.
 *
 * ## Milestone goals get stops instead
 *
 * A checkpoint goal has no scale, because checkpoints are not a quantity. Five
 * of them is not "five units of progress", and drawing them on a ruler implies
 * an evenness that is not there — the fifth checkpoint is nearly always the
 * long one. They are drawn as stops on a line instead, in order, with the ones
 * already reached filled in. That is the same shape the ladder above uses, at
 * a size you can take in without reading.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * A "best ever" figure, which the design this was built from asks for. The
 * goals table keeps `current_value` and nothing behind it, so a personal best
 * is not a number this app has ever recorded — only the value right now, which
 * is overwritten each time it moves. Printing today's value under a "Best"
 * heading would be a fabrication that happens to be right on the day somebody
 * sets a record. It wants a history table, and that is a migration.
