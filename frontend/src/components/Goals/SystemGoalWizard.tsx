/**
 * Setting a system goal — a target on something Summit already counts.
 *
 * ## Why it is not the other wizard
 *
 * The only way to make one used to be NewGoalWizard, which is built for an
 * outcome: it asks what you want to accomplish and why, will not go on without
 * a subject, and then has the model draft checkpoints under the result. None of
 * that applies to a counter, and what came out was not one — it was an outcome
 * goal (`measure: 'milestones'`) filed on the Active tab rather than this one,
 * with five invented checkpoints under "earn 50,000 XP" and no target the app
 * could count toward.
 *
 * A counter is two decisions: which of the four things, and what number. So it
 * is two steps. The first is a list, because the four are the whole choice and
 * each needs a sentence on what exactly it counts — "from today" and "your
 * live streak" behave differently, and the difference is the thing a reader
 * picking one needs to know.
 *
 * Nothing here asks the model for anything, and nothing here asks for a
 * subject: GoalModal's note says why a counter is not about one.
