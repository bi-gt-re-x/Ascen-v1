/**
 * The model filling in a goal's plan: its checkpoints, then the steps under
 * each one.
 *
 * Both model calls already existed — backend/tracking/planner.py drafts five
 * checkpoints for a goal and five steps for a checkpoint — but each was wired
 * to one door and the doors disagreed:
 *
 * - A goal made in the wizard had its checkpoints drafted *over* whatever the
 *   reader had typed on the wizard's last step. `add_goal` wrote their list,
 *   then `set_milestones` renamed every row to the model's.
 * - Those drafted checkpoints never got steps. Only a checkpoint added by hand
 *   in the drawer was broken down, so a new goal arrived as five checkpoints of
 *   three empty prompts each — a plan in outline and nothing under it.
 * - Accepting a drafted ladder on the card was the same: checkpoints, no steps.
 *
 * So the chain lives here, once, and every door runs it:
 *
 *     checkpoints the reader wrote are kept; the model drafts them only when
 *     there are none — and then every checkpoint with no written step, and
 *     not already reached, gets a checklist.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. Every failure is ordinary — no key configured, a model
 * that did not answer, an answer that could not be read — and comes back as
 * `problem`, worded by the server for the page to print, beside counts of what
 * did get written. A goal whose plan could not be drafted is still a goal.
