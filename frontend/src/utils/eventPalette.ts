/**
 * The calendar's colour system: twelve families, six shades each.
 *
 * Every colour on the calendar comes from here. Nothing draws a hex of its own
 * — the components carry a family name and the stylesheet turns it into the
 * right shade for the job, which is what makes a week of forty blocks read as
 * one design rather than as forty decisions. The hexes themselves live once, in
 * styles/calendar/palette.css, as `--event-<family>-100` … `-600`; this module
 * holds the same values so the arithmetic below (how far apart two families
 * are, which family a subject belongs to) can be done in TypeScript, and the
 * two are checked against each other by `PALETTE` being the source both were
 * written from.
 *
 * **What replaced what.** Blocks used to be given a random hex apiece, kept a
 * distance from every other hex handed out. That produced a calendar where no
 * two blocks matched and none of them meant anything: colour was noise with a
 * uniqueness guarantee. Colour is now *semantic* — a family per kind of work,
 * so every Chemistry block on the account is the same teal and the reader
 * learns the calendar rather than re-reading it. Only the shade varies, and it
 * varies by role.
 *
 * **The ladder, and what each rung is for.** Six shades, lightest to darkest:
 *
 *   100  the event background in light mode
 *   200  secondary background, subtle hover
 *   300  hover / active background
 *   400  the primary accent
 *   500  borders, icons, labels — the edge down a block's left side
 *   600  text and emphasis
 *
 * Every shade is a real colour rather than an opacity of one. A block drawn
 * with `rgba(x, .4)` over a grid line shows the grid line; it also changes
 * colour when it overlaps its neighbour, which is exactly the "chaotic
 * rainbow" a calendar with thirty blocks on it cannot afford.
 *
 * **The shades were generated, not picked.** One lightness ladder across all
 * twelve families with per-family saturation, so the families have the same
 * visual weight — a green and a yellow at the same rung look equally strong,
 * which is the thing that stops a palette reading as a rainbow. The darkest
 * rung of each family is then darkened until it clears 4.6:1 against that
 * family's lightest, so 600-on-100 is readable in every family and not only in
 * the ones that happen to be dark. Nothing is neon (saturation tops out at
 * .72), nothing is near-white (the lightest sits at 85% lightness) and nothing
 * is near-black (the darkest floors at 25%).
