/**
 * Which layout a block gets, and the pixels that decide it.
 *
 * `layOut` picks one of three shapes from a block's length — one strip, two
 * lines, or the full four — and the thresholds are pure arithmetic against a
 * height the same function computes. That makes this exactly the kind of rule
 * that breaks silently: `.wk-event` is `overflow: hidden`, so a block asked to
 * draw more lines than it has room for does not overflow, spill or throw. It
 * simply has its last line cut through the middle, which reads as a rendering
 * glitch rather than as a layout decision that has stopped being true.
 *
 * That is what had happened. The one-strip ceiling was twenty minutes and the
 * two-line layout needs thirty, so every block between them — a twenty-five
 * minute meditation, a quarter-past to quarter-to — was drawn with a name and
 * a floor for its time and six pixels less than the pair required.
 *
 * So the assertions below are about the *boundary*, not about the middle of
 * each band: 29 and 30 are the two numbers worth pinning, and the second half
 * checks that the shape chosen actually fits the height chosen alongside it.
