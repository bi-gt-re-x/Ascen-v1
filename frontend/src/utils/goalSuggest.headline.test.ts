/**
 * The one sentence the Goals tab opens with, and the setting that orders it.
 *
 * `leadWithStrength` comes from `toneRules()`. The property worth pinning is
 * not the wording — that will change — but the invariant underneath it: both
 * orders carry both figures, and neither invents or drops a goal. A sentence
 * that softened a shortfall by leaving it out would be the exact failure
 * utils/analyticsPrefs says a tone setting must never be.
