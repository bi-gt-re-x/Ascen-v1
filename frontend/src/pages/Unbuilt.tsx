/**
 * The pages that are routed but not built.
 *
 * They were a file each, and files of twenty lines that differed only in three
 * strings are a table pretending to be a module tree. Here it is the table, and
 * one component that reads the path it was rendered at.
 *
 * There were eight. Tasks was the first to leave — it is pages/Tasks.tsx now,
 * with its own route in App.tsx, which is exactly the exit this file's own
 * instructions below describe. Growth Tree left the same way and is
 * pages/SkillTrees.tsx; its old path redirects, because the placeholder was
 * routed long enough for links to it to exist. Notes left next, into
 * pages/Notes.tsx over the table data/sql/notes.sql had been holding for it.
 * Settings and Achievements left together, over the two schemas that had been
 * waiting for them — three left.
 *
 * The point of these is honesty. Each route in the top bar and in the app's
 * structure resolves to something that says what it will be, rather than to a
 * blank screen that reads as a bug — and it names the files it will be built
 * from, so the placeholder doubles as the note for whoever picks it up.
 *
 * `PATHS` is exported because App.tsx builds the routes from it. Adding a page
 * here is one entry, not a file and a lazy import and a <Route>. Building one
 * for real is the reverse: give it its own module, drop its entry, and the
 * route in App.tsx stops being generated and becomes its own line.
 *
 * The stylesheets that used to sit beside these — achievements.css,
 * notes.css and the rest — were five-line comments reserving a filename. A
 * page that does not exist does not need a stylesheet to not have rules in;
 * the real one can create it on the day it has something to style.
