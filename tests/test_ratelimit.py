"""Guessing a password has to get expensive.

/api/login had no limit of any kind: a script could try passwords against an
account as fast as the network allowed, forever, and nothing in the app would
notice. The hashing is real and the session key is no longer guessable, so the
front door was the only way in and it was unlocked.

Three things are worth pinning here, and only the first is about counting:

    1. a budget exists, and running it out answers 429 rather than another
       "invalid credentials" the script can keep hammering;
    2. **only failures count.** A reader who mistypes and then gets it right
       must not be locked out, and a busy session must never be throttled —
       this is the property most likely to be broken by a later edit, because
       it is invisible until somebody hits it;
    3. the window slides, so a caller who waits gets back in.

`test_every_credential_endpoint_is_limited` walks the app's own routes rather
than listing paths, in the spirit of test_guard: an auth endpoint added next
year is covered the day it is written, and exempting one is a deliberate edit
somebody has to justify.
