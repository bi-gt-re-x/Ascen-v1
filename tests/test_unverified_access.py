"""An unconfirmed e-mail address does not lock the account out.

Confirming an address used to be a door in front of the whole app: signing up
parked the account, `/api/login` refused it, `complete_profile` refused it, and
nothing behind the gate opened until a link in an inbox had been followed. The
cost of that fell entirely on people who had not yet decided they wanted the
app — a trip out to another application, often another device, before they had
seen anything worth the trip.

The door is a banner now. These tests pin the four things that had to change
for that, and the two that had to *not* change with them: the address is still
unconfirmed, and it is still asked for.

See `signup` in backend/routes/auth.py for the reasoning, and
frontend/src/components/VerifyBanner.tsx for what replaced the door.
