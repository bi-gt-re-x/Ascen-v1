"""The model-written panel on a subject's page.

Nothing here calls a model. What is worth testing is everything around the
call — the shape that goes in, the bounds that come out, and the two states
that are not "it worked": no key, and an answer that cannot be read.

The rule the feature exists to keep is that the model may write prose over the
page's figures and may not produce any others. That rule lives in the prompt
and cannot be asserted from here, so what these tests hold instead is the
structure that makes it enforceable: the brief carries the figures verbatim,
and the one number the model does supply is bounded on the way out.
